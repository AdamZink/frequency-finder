# frequency-finder

Find target frequencies in an audio signal

### Applications

Iteratively find the correct quantity of frequencies by comparing to known target:

```python app_count.py```

Iteratively find the correct frequency values by comparing to known target:

```python app_frequency_values.py```

Use a genetic algorithm to find the correct frequency values by comparing to known target:

```python app_genetic.py```

### Tests

```cd frequency-finder```

```python -m unittest```
